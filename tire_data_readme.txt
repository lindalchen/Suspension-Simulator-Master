The goal of tire data analysis is to find insight based the tire's physical properties 
to drive suspension design. In other words, tire data analysis motivates suspension 
design almost completely. The steps to finding optimal suspension design based on 
tire data are as follows:

STEP 1: Download TTC data in the form of .dat files. 

STEP 2: Determine normal force vs slip angle. 

STEP 3: Find the affect of camber on normal force vs. slip angle using 
curve fitting techniques. 

STEP 3: Determine a general range of operating normal forces. 

STEP 4: Given a normal force from the range in step 3, 
determine what camber gives you the highest friction coefficient.
In other words, we are finding the optimal camber for a given normal force, 
meaning that the particular camber gives the highest value of friction 
coefficient for a given normal force. 

STEP 5: Generate a curve of optimal camber vs. normal force.

STEP 6: Based on the curve obtained in step 5, generate a curve of 
optimal camber vs wheel displacement. This in effect determines 
suspension geometry.
